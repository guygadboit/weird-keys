Run the program with:

go run *.go

It takes a few minutes, and then prints out a number like 93/100. The question
why is that so high? You might expect 50/100.

It's looking at whether the similarity between two random streams drops in the
regions where *either* of the streams matches some arbitary key from a set of
random keys, compared to if only one of them does.

For some reason the similarity is fairly consistently lower if you match on
either stream rather than just one of them.
